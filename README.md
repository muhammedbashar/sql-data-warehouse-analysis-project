🏗️ Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution — from ingesting raw data to delivering actionable insights.

Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in modern data engineering and analytics using SQL Server.

🧱 Data Architecture

The project follows the Medallion Architecture pattern (Bronze → Silver → Gold), ensuring clean data flow, reusability, and scalability.
